# **CHANGELOG**

## **2.3.1**
### ENHANCEMENTS
- Updated Storage Scale software version: The Storage Scale version used for configuration of the compute and storage clusters has been updated from version 5.1.9.0 to 5.1.9.2
- Updated RHEL stock image versionfor storage node from ibm-redhat-8-8-minimal-amd64-2 to ibm-redhat-8-8-minimal-amd64-3
- Updated RHEL stock image version for compute node from ibm-redhat-7-9-minimal-amd64-11 to ibm-redhat-7-9-minimal-amd64-12

## **2.3.0**
### ENHANCEMENTS
- Enabling CES Feature: You can now enable CES feature to enable access to data stored in Storage Scale. By providing non-zero value to total_protocol_cluster_instances variable.

By setting up the ldap_basedns deployment value to the required domain name during the deployment, the LDAP feature is integrated along with the Scale CES.
- Updated RHEL stock image version: The RHEL stock image version was updated from RHEL 8.6 to RHEL 8.8.

## **2.2.1**
### ENHANCEMENTS
- Encryption with GKLM: You can now encrypt your Storage Scale cluster file system by using the IBM Security速 Guardium速 Key Lifecycle Manager (GKLM).
- Parallel vNIC (Virtual Network Interface Controller): Create a secondary vNIC for higher VSI profiles to separate the data and storage traffic across different vNICs for higher bandwidth and better performance.
- Sapphire Rapids-based virtual server instance profile support: The solution now supports deployment of compute nodes on virtual server instance profiles that make use of 4th Generation Intel速 Xeon速 Scalable processors (code named Sapphire Rapids). Those profiles can be used only with the RHEL 8.8 custom image.
